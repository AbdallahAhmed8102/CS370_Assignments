# Anomaly Detection on MVTec-AD Dataset

## Introduction
This project aims to evaluate anomaly detection methods on the MVTec-AD dataset using the Anomalib library.

## Dataset
The MVTec-AD dataset contains images across various categories, focusing on flat surfaces in this study: tile, leather, and grid.

## Methods
- **PatchCore**: Anomaly detection based on coreset representation.
- **EfficientAD**: A method designed for efficiency in anomaly detection.

## Results
The AUROC scores for both models across categories are presented in the visualization.

## Conclusion
Both models showed varying performance levels, and insights from the results will guide further research in anomaly detection methodologies.
